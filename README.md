The mod allows rebalance Free Update of your games.

# [How it works?]
This mod allows rebalance Free Update of your games.

For now, the following three can be adjusted.
1. Costs of Free Update ( Default : 1, The higher this value, the higher cost you require to development.)
2. Add Points of Free Update ( Default : 1, The higher this value, the more points you get.)
3. Development Time of Free Update ( Default : 1, The lower this value, the slower to development)
